            <p>Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is supposed to be a continuation of the Harry Potter series.</p>
            <p class= "big">HOWEVER,</p>
            <p class="secondBig">it meets none of the expected requirements.</p>
            <div class="listOfBad">
                <p>For example,</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Cursed Child is written in script format, which has been the cause of outcry among many fans.</li>
                    <li>Albus, as a main character, is rather bland and unappealing. This is probably due to the script format, in which his parts are minute and concise, like in a show or play.</li>
                    <li>Character development, overall, is incredibly low, because NO character gets enough time to actually develop, except for maybe Harry.</li>
                    <li>There are many plotholes, such as Amos being bitter over Cedric's death, despite his acceptance of it during Goblet of Fire. Another one is Delphie, because there is absolutely no time where Bellatrix could have conceived a child with Voldemort.</li>
                </ul>
